.. _INSTALL:

============
Installation  **(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)**
============
We highly recommend running Mindboggle as a virtual machine,
but for those who wish to install from source code, see
`INSTALL2 <http://mindboggle.info/users/INSTALL2.html>`_.

Dependencies to run Mindboggle
------------------------------
Vagrant_
    Vagrant provides reproducible and portable work environments.
    It isolates dependencies and their configuration within a single
    disposable, consistent environment that can run on
    Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. The single file distributed as Mindboggle
    creates a virtual environment where everything is installed and configured
    to run Mindboggle.

Virtualbox_
    VirtualBox is a x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product.
    We use VirtualBox as a backend provider for Vagrant;
    alternatives include VMware, Amazon Web Services,...

Dependencies to generate input for Mindboggle
---------------------------------------------
FreeSurfer_
    FreeSurfer provides labeled cortical surfaces, and labeled cortical and
    noncortical volumes.
    See `README <http://mindboggle.info/users/README.html>`_ for instructions
    on how to preprocess T1-weighted MRI data using the ``recon-all`` command.

ANTS_
    ANTS provides brain volume extraction, tissue-class segmentation, and
    affine registration that Mindboggle uses to report locations in a standard
    space, and nonlinear registration for whole-brain labeling.
    While these are not required for Mindboggle to run, they improve and
    extend results generated by Mindboggle.
    (Note: After installing ANTS, be sure to copy the files in ANTs/Scripts/
    to the antsbin/bin/ directory, and set the ANTSPATH environment variable.)
    See `README <http://mindboggle.info/users/README.html>`_ for instructions
    on how to preprocess T1-weighted MRI data using the
    ``antsCorticalThickness.sh`` script.

Virtual environment and mounted (FreeSurfer, ANTs) directories
--------------------------------------------------------------
Mindboggle comes as a single installation program, **mindboggle_vagrant.py**,
that you can copy to wherever you want the startup directory to be.
For help on setup options, type in a terminal::

    python mindboggle_vagrant.py --help

The following command will set up a virtual machine that can access
your local ANTs output directory::

    python mindboggle_vagrant.py --ants /data/ants_out

You can also specify more options, for example, to use 8 processors
and up to 4096 MB memory and 75 percent of the CPU::

    python mindboggle_vagrant.py --ants /data/ants_out -n 8 -m 4096 --cpu 75

The above command generates a file called ``Vagrantfile`` that will be used
when we load up the virtual machine
(see `README <http://mindboggle.info/users/README.html>`_).

    `Arno Klein`_ (CV_) is the Director of Neuroimaging and Principal Scientist of Systems Biology
    at Sage Bionetworks (non-profit) in Seattle.
    He was the Principal Investigator of the NIMH R01 grant (MH084029-02) 
    that initially funded the Mindboggle project.
    Arno is excited about brain imaging and visualization of complex information.
    He has conducted research in 3-D display holography from a high school basement lab to MIT's Media Lab,
    tissue optics at Caltech, and automated anatomical brain labeling and shape analysis at Cornell
    and at Columbia Universities.  
    Side projects include the comprehensive photodocumentation of the
    `Ellora cave temples`_ of India, taxonomic classification of `information visualization`_,
    time-lapse photography, and text parsing and analytics.

    `Joachim Giard`_ is a postdoctoral researcher of electrical engineering at
    UCL, Belgium.  He is currently working at the Information and Communication Technologies, 
    Electronics and Applied Mathematics Institute (ICTEAM) in the Communications and 
    Remote Sensing Laboratory (TELE) on image-guided proton therapy in collaboration 
    with an industrial partner.
    Joachim has been developing algorithms for computing shape measures
    on surface meshes for Mindboggle, including travel depth, the topic of his PhD research.

    `Satrajit Ghosh`_ is a Research Scientist in the Research Lab of Electronics at MIT.
    Satrajit is developing the software pipeline framework, NiPype_, 
    that we are building Mindboggle in.  
    Satra's research areas include brain imaging, neuroanatomy, software engineering 
    and speech communication.

    `Nolan Nichols`_ is a PhD candidate in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington. 
    Nolan is developing the informatics infrastructure underlying Mindboggle using a Semantic Web 
    technology stack that explicitly models data provenanceâ€‹.
    He is excited about the translational aspects of the Mindboggle project, 
    and finds this effort to be a nice complement to his thesis work in the areas of 
    semantic data integration and sharing of human neuroimaging data.

    `Martin Reuter`_ is Instructor in Neurology at Harvard Medical School 
    (Massachusetts General Hospital) and works on computational methods for spectral shape analysis, 
    image registration and processing of longitudinal brain MRI data implemented in FreeSurfer. 
    His research interests include computational neuroimaging, computational geometry and toplogy. 
    Mindboggle's Laplace-Beltrami spectra code is a Python port of Martin's Matlab version. 
    Martin has helped the team to develop and evaluate this spectral shape measure.

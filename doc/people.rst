    `Arno Klein`_ (CV_) is a Research Asst. Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science
    at Stony Brook University.
    He was the Principal Investigator of the NIMH R01 grant (MH084029-02) 
    that initially funded the Mindboggle project.
    Arno is excited about brain imaging and visualization of complex information.
    He has conducted research in 3-D display holography from a high school basement lab to MIT's Media Lab,
    tissue optics at Caltech, and automated anatomical brain labeling and shape analysis at Cornell
    and at Columbia Universities.  
    Side projects include the comprehensive photodocumentation of the
    `Ellora cave temples`_ of India, taxonomic classification of `information visualization`_,
    time-lapse photography, and text parsing and analytics.

    Joachim Giard is a postdoctoral researcher of electrical engineering at
    UCL, Belgium.  He is currently working at the Information and Communication Technologies, 
    Electronics and Applied Mathematics Institute (ICTEAM) in the Communications and 
    Remote Sensing Laboratory (TELE) on image-guided proton therapy in collaboration 
    with an industrial partner.
    Joachim has been developing algorithms for computing shape measures
    on surface meshes for Mindboggle, including travel depth, the topic of his PhD research.

    `Nolan Nichols`_ is a PhD student in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the
    University of Washington.  Nolan is building a graph database to support the 
    informatics infrastructure underlying Mindboggle. He is excited about the 
    translational aspects of the Mindboggle project, and finds this effort to be a nice 
    complement to his thesis work in the areas of semantic data integration and sharing 
    of human neuroimaging data.
